# Hello There ðŸ‘‹

For today my task was : Use the hazelcast server you set up in HAZELCAST-EX-02 and create sample java program that puts a dummy Person object into the Hazelcast map 10,000 times ( in a for loop). Then, get these objects from the Hazelcast map

## Steps:

## 1- First we create a project using Maven and add dependencies in our pom.xml file.

## 2- Then we can write our code. ( HazelcastClientApp.java and Person.java)

## 3- Now we run Hazelcast in our terminal.

## 4- And lastly run our HazecastClientApp.java and the result terminal should look like this. *

**Note for step 4: I only print the first and last ten objects to avoid cluttering the output with the entire list of 1000 records.*
