# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For today my assignment is : Pull & run Kafka container from Docker Hub in your GCP or AWS cloud machine. (You can use confluent oï¬€cial docker- repo ). For being more practical, you can run in your local machine first, and then, you can switch to cloud machine.

## Steps:

## 1-First in SSH terminal we update our terminal and tools then install Docker in our VM and create .yml file for install Kafka and ZooKeeper.

## 2- Then in the opened file-write terminal screen we bring up commands for installing  Kafka and ZooKeeper with configuration.

## 5- Lastly to launch our services; we use "sudo docker-compose up -d" command and finisihing our task with checking proccess status.
