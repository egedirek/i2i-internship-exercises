# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For today my assignement was : Create 2 sample java programs; one for Producer one for Consumer. Publish java objects ( you can use following class ) from Producer app. Read those objects from Consumer app and print them to the console.

## Steps 
 
## 1-First create a project folder in your IDE and use Maven for Kafka.


## 2-Create a folder include compose.yml file for attach our code to Kafka and Kafka to Docker Dektop with ZooKeeper.

## 6- Conclusion: You should see these messages on order in your terminals. Our producer app successfully read and print our object.ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

* Waiting for messages..  // message in your StudentConsumer terminal
* Sent: Student{id=42, name='Ege'}  // message in your StudentProducer terminal
* Received: Student{id=42, name='Ege'}  // message in your StudentConsumer terminal
