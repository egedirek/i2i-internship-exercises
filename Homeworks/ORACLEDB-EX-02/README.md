# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For today my task is : pull & run oracle express edition container from docker hub in your GCP or AWS cloud machine. ( You can use oracle oï¬ƒcial repo- the link is provided below â€“ ). For being more practical, you can run in your local machine first, and then, you can switch to cloud machine. Necesarry command are provided below.

## Steps:

## 1- First we have to download Oracle Docker image. ( I already have it so I dont have screen-shot )

*git clone https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git*

## 2- Now we open docker file then we can build the docker image.
