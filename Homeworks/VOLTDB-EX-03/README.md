# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For today my task is Connect VoltDB instance that you have created in the VOLTDB -EX-03 exercise from DBeaver. In order to connect VoltDB from DBeaver, you should create a new database driver ( Database â†’ Driver Manager menu ) and download VoltDB client jar from maven repo. Create sample table and insert some rows as shown below. Please also connect VoltDB UI from 55004 port ( you can inspect port mappings via docker ps command. )
Note: If you did not get a cloud machine previously, you may simply run it on your local machine.

Sample Table Creation, and Row Insertion:
create table mth3902 (
id bigint not null,
start_date_epoch bigint,
create_user varchar(32),
constraint mth3902_pk primary key(id)
);
partition table mth3902 on column id;
--- dr table mth3902;
insert into mth3902 ( id, start_date_epoch, create_user ) values ( 1, 1698295044, 'MENNAN');
insert into mth3902 ( id, start_date_epoch, create_user ) values ( 2, 1698295088, 'ERKUT');
select * from mth3902 limit 1;
