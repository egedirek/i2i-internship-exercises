# Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For today my task is : pull & run voltdb container from docker hub in your GCP or AWS cloud machine. (You can use voltdb community docker- repo ). For being more practical, you can run in your local machine first, and then, you can switch to cloud machine

## Steps:

### 1- For pull and run VoltDB in our virtual machine type these in your terminal.

### 2- You can check your container and image if its created. If it is created type  _http://[VM_EXTERNAL_IP]:8080_ in your web browser and you should see VoltDB Management Center screen.
